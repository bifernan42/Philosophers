# Project Philosophers

## Concepts: [Concurrency, Multithreading, Mutexes, Synchronization, Deadlocks, Race Conditions]  

### Project Overview:  
- **Simulates multiple philosophers** sitting around a table with a bowl of spaghetti.  
- Each philosopher must **grab two forks** to eat, then return them before sleeping.  
- The challenge is to **avoid deadlocks and starvation** while handling concurrent execution.  
- Implemented using **pthreads and mutexes** (mandatory) and **processes and semaphores** (bonus).    

This project provides a strong **introduction to concurrent programming**, 
teaching **thread synchronization, resource sharing, and deadlock prevention techniques**.
